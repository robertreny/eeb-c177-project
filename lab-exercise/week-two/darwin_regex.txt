I used the look behind and look ahead commands to specify a selection coming 
after a . or a ? and a space and before a space. The selection involved any 
letters since no first word had numbers, including punctuation. The first word
 was not selected so I added an or statement to the beginning to select 
Natural. The ^ worked to select that Natural because the whole paragraph is 
being treated as a string so only the first "Natural" was picked up.
